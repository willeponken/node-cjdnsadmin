Documentation (Work In Progress)
===

The documents here are for both node-cjdnsadmin and native CJDNS.

## Index
* __cjdns-admin-api.md__ - The CJDNS Admin API documentation, forked from the CJDNS repository.
* __node-cjdnsadmin.md__ - The node-cjdnsadmin documentation explaining both native and abstracted functions.

##TODO
- [ ] Add example data for node-cjdnsadmin.md, thinking of this format:

> #### Example;
> __Code:__
>
> `Some code here`
>
> __Data:__
>
> `{ "some": "data here" }`

- [ ] Document all of the native CJDNS function in node-cjdnsadmin.md
- [ ] Rewrite cjdns-admin-api.md with new functions, and also add example data for everything
